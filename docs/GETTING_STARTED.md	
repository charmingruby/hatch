# Getting Started

## 1 - Update Module Path

- Replace all instances of the placeholder module path with your own:

```bash
github.com/charmingruby/pack
```

2 - Modules
- The internal/ directory contains a sample module structure.
- Use it as a starting point to organize and develop your own modules.

3 - Testing
- Ensure test support is properly configured, including usage of mockery.
- Refer to the Makefile for available test commands and setup instructions.

4 - Persistence Layer
- PostgreSQL is configured as the default database.
- Youâ€™ll find ready-to-use assets including:
    - SQL migration files;
    - Database setup scripts;
    - Sample repository pattern implementation;
