# Bootstrap

- `.bootstrap` is a simple directory that contains everything needed to set up the development environment.  
- The Makefile at the project root should provide two commands:  
  - **bootstrap**: prepares and configures the environment.  
  - **cleanup**: removes all setup and resets the environment.
