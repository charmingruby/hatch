## What is Hatch?

A **production-ready Go template** focused on:
- **Modularity** - Self-contained features
- **Clarity** - Flat structure, explicit dependencies
- **Speed** - Ship features fast without fighting architecture

---

## Core Rules

### âœ… Always Do
- Keep changes **inside the module** you're working on
- Follow existing patterns and naming
- Respect dependency flow: `provider/` â†’ `usecase/` â†’ `domain/`
- Test every use case
- Keep files small and focused

### ðŸš« Never Do
- Add new architectural layers
- Bypass use cases (handler â†’ provider directly)
- Cross-import between modules
- Use global vars or `panic()`
- Refactor unrelated code

## Module Structure (Quick Reference)

```
internal/note/
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/       â†’ Entities + Interfaces (pure Go)
â”œâ”€â”€ usecase/      â†’ Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ provider/     â†’ External services (DB, APIs, cache, queues)
â”œâ”€â”€ http/         â†’ HTTP handlers
â””â”€â”€ module.go     â†’ Dependency wiring
```

**Key principle:** `domain/` defines interfaces, `provider/` implements them.

---

## When in Doubt

1. Check **README.md** for full architecture explanation
2. Look at `internal/note/` as reference implementation
3. Ask: "What's the **simplest change** that keeps modules independent?"

**Remember:** Hatch is not a framework â€” it's a clear, idiomatic Go foundation. Keep it simple.
